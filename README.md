# fansabisu

The missing AniTwitter feature for the iOS Twitter clients. I made this app because there's a lot of really cool GIFs shared on Twitter, but sadly Twitter converts everything to MOV (or MP4?) and I couldn't really find a good way to download + transcode these movies back into GIFs.

[Here](https://twitter.com/Ruenzuo/status/789928660291682305/video/1)'s a good example of what the app can do at the moment.

fansabisu is available in the App Store as [Rubesty](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rubesty/id1169137595?mt=8).

## Building

This project doesn't use any dependency manager so just open the `FanSabisu.xcodeproj` and building should work as long as the Xcode version supports the Swift 3.0 and you provide the [missing sensitive information files](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/fansabisu/blob/master/.gitignore#L3-L4).
