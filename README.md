# fansabisu

The missing AniTwitter feature for the iOS Twitter clients. I made this app because there's a lot of really cool GIFs shared on Twitter, but sadly Twitter converts everything to MOV (or MP4?) and I couldn't really find a good way to download + transcode these movies back into GIFs.

## Building

This project doesn't use any dependency manager so just open the `FanSabisu.xcodeproj` and building should work as long as the Xcode version supports the Swift 3.0.
